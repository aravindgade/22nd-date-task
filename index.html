    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One such problem is environment-driven. Haythornthwaite et al., (2000)
coin a term, “fade back,” to describe students & do not participate in the
distance class. They point out that the “fading back” is accomplished easier
in distance learning environments where the number of social cues is reduced.
These cues include text without voice, voice without body language, class
attendance without seating arrangements, students signing in without attending (Haythornthwaite et al., 2000). This implies that in similar classes, with
similar levels of student interests, the likelihood of students “fading back” is
greater in distance learning classes than in face-to-face classes.</p>

    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Real learning seems to have a significant social component. As distance
education evolves, it must be able to recognize and incorporate this component. There are stakeholders with pragmatic requirements that must be
addressed. Employers want employees with both technical skills and skills
that are “socially driven.” Finally, into this mix an appropriate level of
technology is added with the desire to remove the student from the physical
confines of the classroom. This leads one to consider how technology and
people interact.</p>

    <h2>HOW TECHNOLOGY AND PEOPLE INTERACT</h2>
    </center>
    
    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp;As one thinks about distance education, it must be acknowledged that
distance education incorporates many factors such as how individuals are
motivated to learn and how individuals interact with technology. Looking at
theories from each of these areas can help guide our investigation. First, there
are a set of theories that have developed around the individuals and how
        individuals learn. These are labeled <i>foundation theories</i>because motivation
to learn must exist before distance learning can be effective. Second, as
technology has become more and more necessary to enable distance education, theories have been developed about how individuals and groups interact
with technology. These theories are classified as technology interaction
theories because they predict how individuals and groups interact with
technology. These theories grow from the technology-oriented areas such as
group support systems and collaborative work. Here researchers have been
studying how people interact productively with technology. Commonalities
across these foundation theories and technology interaction theories can help
understand some of the issues faced by distance education.</p>
    
    
    <br>
    
    <h3>Foundation Theories</h3>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Foundation theories, such as Field Theory, Social Exchange Theory, and
Needs Theory, try to explain the various behaviors exhibited by individuals</p>
    
    <br><br><br>
    
    <p><i>Table 1: Technology Interaction and Foundation Theories</i></p>

    </center>
    
    <p>in groups. Briefly, Field Theory (Lewin, 1951) looks at the group dynamics
caused by how individuals behave to overcome barriers as they try to achieve
a goal. Lewin relates learning to this motivation (Chaplin & Krawiec, 1960).
In groups, the large number of possible interactions complicates this behavior. Social Exchange Theory describes behavior in terms of its rewards and
costs. “Rewards are pleasurable outcomes associated with particular behaviors; costs include such things as mental effort, anxiety or even embarrassment (Beebe & Masterson, 1986). Viewed in this economic way, individuals
will seek to establish relationships that accrue a net positive analysis. In
addition, individuals will enact behaviors to continue those relationships with
a positive value.</p>
    
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1943, Abraham Maslow presented a first, rough draft of his Need
Hierarchy Theory. Subsequently, he and his fellow researchers tested and
adapted the theory for organizational settings. Essentially, the theory
proposes that human beings have a set of “staircased” needs that interact
and “combine with [other] biological, cultural and situational factors to
determine behavior” (Miner, 1980). Of interest to us in this discussion is
the need in which Maslow includes the desire for a sense of affiliation and
general belongingness – broadly termed the “love needs” (Miner, 1980).
Along these same lines, Aldefer (1972) included these needs in his “threestaired” Existence-Relatedness-Growth (ERG) Theory as relatedness
needs. Both theories propose that when these needs are not satisfied (and
the needs below this level are), the behavior of an individual will try to
satisfy these needs. For example, until the lower-level “security needs”
are satisfied for an individual, that individual will act to satisfy these
lower-level needs before acting to satisfy needs on a “higher” stair. The
research results showed much more complexity than just discussed, but,
in general, the conjectures from the theories have held.</p>
    
    <br><br><br>
    
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the more practical areas that use this need hierarchy model is
the job enrichment program. The “need for affiliation” has been found to
be a key ingredient in helping with achievement motivation (McClelland,
1961; Shipley & Veroff, 1952) and has been related to job satisfaction
(Miner, 1980). Complementing this idea is that of a reference group
whereby individuals “express” their “need for affiliation.” Kelley (1951)
identifies two such groups: comparative group, in which the individual
compares and contrasts his or her stature — peer group — and reference
group, to which the individual identifies with the general feelings. Students comparing their SAT test scores to others in the class represents a
comparative group, while promoting the Sierra Club with a bumper
sticker would constitute a reference group.</p>
    
    <br>
    
    <h3>Technology Interaction Theories</h3>
    
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the key areas that deals with technology and its impact on manual
human-based processes is in the realm of group support systems (GSSs).
Group Support Systems add a technology component to how groups work
together (DeSanctis & Gallupe, 1985), much like distance education is adding
a technology component to learning. GSS research has been a major contributor to the body of knowledge concerning group interactions and learning. In
GSSs, manual methods for meetings and group work (Delbecq & Van de Ven,
1971; Linstone & Turoff, 1975; Saaty, 1980; Osborn, 1953) have been
automated and the interaction of technology with people studied (Briggs et al.,
1998; Fjermestad & Hiltz, 1999). As the researchers studied the impact of
automating these processes, theories evolved. Essentially, face-to-face meeting environments are said to have many media to communicate information;
these include verbal (e.g., tone of voice, volume) and nonverbal (e.g., body
language, facial expressions). As technology is added to the process, it
produces a lens that impacts the media by either a) restricting the flow of
information, or b) missing some of the information completely. Tu (2000)
refers to this as the “technological social presence.” Figure 1 provides a
simple diagram for further discussion.</p>
    
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social Information Processing Theory (SIP) (Chidambaram, 1996;
Walther, 1992) and Adaptive Structuration Theory (AST) (Poole & DeSanctis,
1990), suggest that the technology – the lens – is a limiting factor or constraint
for communication. Each theory, in its own way, discusses how the senders
of the cues adapt to the lens. SIP suggests that, over time, the sender will be
able to get all the cues through; it simply takes more time. The senders choose
to use their limited channel to process the task-oriented communications first,
and then, if time permits, the theory predicts that the more social communi-</p>
    
    <br><br><br>
    
    <p><i>Figure 1: Technology Lens</i></p>
    
    <center>
    <img src="Screenshot%20(403).png">
    </center>
    
    <br>
    <p>cations would follow. AST proposes a different tactic with the same end;
that the senders figure out alternative ways to send the cues based upon
what is “allowed” through the lens. The term used for this action is
“appropriation” and “refers to the manner in which structures are adapted
by a group for its own use …” (Gopal et al., 1993). A good example here
is how a sender of email may use emoticons (e.g., :) – sarcastic smile, ;)
– wink , :o – exclamation of surprise) to communicate more emotion about
the subject to receiver. These theories, SIP and AST, tend to predict that
the channel works over a period of time.</p>
    
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Media Richness Theory (Daft & Lengel, 1986) suggests that the inherent
characteristics of the technology filter out cues and ultimately these cues do
not make it through the lens to provide information to the receiver; in the case
of group support systems, to the group process. The richness of the media—
the size of the lens—directly impacts the effectiveness of the technology in the
situation. The capacity of the channel to provide communication defines the
richness of the channel. A face-to-face meeting offers a “richer media” than
does a posted letter. Social Presence Theory (Short et al., 1976) argues that
since the lens limits the amount of cues that may make it through, most cues
will be action or task-oriented. In other words, the lens hampers the cues that
provide for the receivers to “observe” any social cues. This means that the
ability to observe or understand the other person in the communication is
minimized.</p>
    
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Leidner and Jarvenpaa (1995) identify several learning models and
propose how the current practices of using information technology works
with each. One of the drivers for their work is a concern that information
technology may be speeding up ineffective methods of teaching. In their
analysis, they create a matrix showing the different technologies being used
and to which learning model, each technology fits best. For Leidner and
Jarvenpaa (1995), distance learning fit best with the “Objectivist” learning
model. They defined this model with the basic premise of “learning is the</p>

    
    <br><br><br>
    
    <p>uncritical absorption of objective knowledge,” and the goals of “transfer
of knowledge” and “recall of knowledge.” The model that has the goal of
“promoting socialization,” including “group skills [such as] communication, listening, and participation” is termed “Collaborativism.” The best
technology fit for this learning model was “asynchronous communication
across distances” such as email or asynchronous groupware. In essence,
they are proposing that different modes of information technology represent different lenses.</p>
    
    <h2>CURRENT RESEARCH AND CONJECTURES</h2>
    
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The debate still rages as to the effectiveness of distance education. The
complex environment contains issues around how students learn, what
motivates students to learn, how to make the learning environment better,
how to make the environment worthwhile for all the stakeholders and how
technology impacts the learning environment. Several researchers and educators are studying how distance education classes create a sense of community
(Haythornthwaite et al., 2000; Dede, 1996). The study of these complex issues
and interactions falls into the broad field of Social Informatics (Kling, 2000),
which is defined as the study of the interaction of information technologies
with an institutional and cultural perspective.</p>
    
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Studies are forthcoming. A review of over 400 studies compared distance to
traditional classroom instruction with complex and conflicting results (Russell,
2001). On the positive side, faculty at eCollege.com reported that their students
learned equally effectively online as they did on campus (TeleEducation NB,
2001). GSS studies are identifying and reconfirming the important characteristics
in developing a sense of community, such as satisfaction (Chidambaram &
Bostrom, 1997); trust (Aranda et al., 1998); cohesiveness (Chidambaram, 1996);
and participation (Nunamaker et al., 1991). However, distance learning environments may be creating some additional concerns such as higher rates of student
anxiety and frustration (Hora & Kling, forthcoming) and these environments may
inherit the GSS characteristic of less consensus in decision making (Daft &
Lengel, 1986; Briggs et al., 1998).</p>
    
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;From these perspectives, distance learning must address both the technical content and the social aspects of the individuals. Even if the class is started
and taught as an “objectivist” view, students will ultimately include the social
aspects of the “collaborativism” view. This seems to be the case in a study
wherein distance students performed better than their on-campus counterparts (Black, 1997). The researcher conducting the study attributed the
findings to the online students compensating for not having time in class to
talk.</p>
    
    <br><br><br>
    
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Going even further, one can view the “need for affiliation” as a social
need that helps with learning. This proposal is best aligned with the Social
Information Processing Theory where Chidambaram (1996) describes one
underlying premise of the theory this way: “Implicit in the SIP perspective is
the idea that users of computer media are driven by these needs [affiliation
motive – the need to like and to be liked by others] just as much as those in
non-computer settings.”</p>
    
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;With Figure 1 in mind again, one would assume that the group process
created by the technology lens in a distance class would be less “media rich”
than that created by the traditional classroom. In addition, the “need for
affiliation” between the individuals in two classes should be the same.
Combining these two assumptions, one would expect to see more behavior
geared to creating or attaining social cues in the distance learning class than
in the face-to-face class.</p>
    
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;This chapter describes one study performed to look at the above issue in
more detail. The study used an MBA-level, introductory Information Systems
course to compare traditional on-campus students with students taking the
same class in a distance learning environment. The initial hypotheses centered
on the need for affiliation; the prediction was that students in distance classes
(DIST) would show more “need for affiliation” than students in on-campus
classes (ONC). The following outcomes were expected:</p>
    
    <p>H1: DIST will have higher levels of satisfaction with groups and group work
than ONC</p>
    <p>H2: DIST will have higher levels of group cohesiveness than ONC</p>
    <p>H3: DIST will have more participation in groups than ONC.</p>

    <h2>THE RESEARCH STUDY</h2>
    </center>
    
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A questionnaire with 42 items was given to both groups. The questions
asked about demographics, perception of technology and perception of group
work. Short answer and seven-point Likert questions were used (1 = Strongly
Agree ... 7 = Strongly Disagree). An example of the questionnaire is provided
in Appendix A. The questionnaire was provided to both MBA classes. As
previously mentioned one class was conducted totally by distance (DIST)
while, the other was on-campus (ONC). A total of 42 students responded: 25
from the on-campus class and 17 from the distance class.</p>
    
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The analysis of the data is exploratory in nature and as such is subject to
several limitations. First, the questionnaire was developed to measure a broad
set of characteristics that interact in many ways. A factor analysis will help
decompose these characteristics for revising the questionnaire. Second, the</p>
    
    <br><br><br>
    
    <p>two classes were separated in time; they were taught in subsequent semesters
and while the learning goals were the same, the exposure to topics varied.
Finally, the low number of responses demands a more conservative statistical
analysis that may not find subtle differences. The items with statistically
significant results are provided in Table 2 below.</p>
    
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;As discussed, the results of the prior research in this area are mixed.
H1 and H2 were not supported, and H3 was only partially supported. The
ONC group reported meeting more times per week than the DIST group
(Q12), and more of the ONC time in meetings was spent on socialization
than task (Q13). This is contrary to the expectations in terms of the need
for affiliation.</p>
    
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the DIST group reported spending more time in meetings
(Q11) and a greater percentage of that time on task than ONC group (Q14).
So while DIST group held fewer meetings than the ONC group, they spent
more time in each meeting than the ONC group. In addition, they spent more
time on task than the ONC group. It is interesting to note that the DIST groups
strongly disagreed that there was too much socialization in the group (Q24).</p>
    
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was anticipated that the technology would play a part in how much time
was spent in meetings and how much of the meeting time was spent on
socialization (Figure 1). It is possible that the technology was inhibiting the
number of meetings for the DIST group. The DIST group reported using</p>
    
    
    <p><i>Table 2: Distance vs. on-campus characteristics</i></p>
    <center>
    <img src="Screenshot%20(404).png">
    </center>
    
    <br><br><br>
    
    <p>email, phones, and an asynchronous forum for communication. These technologies are not very rich in nature. So it may not be so surprising that the
DIST group met less often (“..we’ve got the technology working, let’s keep
going while we can…”) and had less socializing (“…who knows how much
longer the technology will last – better not waste time socializing…”). The
DIST group may have used email (at other times) to do their socializing.
Examples of this might be sending short emails inquiring about weather or
sporting events, inquiring about personal issues, or exchanging jokes. The
DIST group may not have considered these emails to be part of a meeting. This
scenario is diagrammed below (Figure 2).</p>
    
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The DIST students may have satisfied the need to socialize in other ways,
and therefore did not need to do so while in their meetings. This would make
sense if the technology they were using for their meetings was not very rich.</p>
    
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Very few satisfaction characteristics were significant. The ONC group
disagreed more strongly that it was disappointed with how the course worked
out (4.61 for DIST vs. 5.44 for ONC (Q29). At the same time, the DIST
students (3.66 for DISTvs. 2.50 for ONC) did not agree as strongly as the ONC
students that everyone in the group did their fair share (Q31). With regard to
the technology measures, there was no significant difference between the two
groups; however, the DIST students did feel that the technology helped them
get their work done (2.11). It should be noted that the questionnaire did not
explicitly ask them if the technology helped them socialize, or if it inhibited
their efforts to socialize.</p>

    <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
    </center>
    
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In summary, as technology moves quickly to enable distance education
and learning environments, one concern that has to be dealt with is how
students best interact with the technology. In understanding this, one must
first understand the process of learning and then the process by which people
interact with technology. This paper has provided a brief review of some of
the theories in these areas. Socialization and its impact on learning were
prevalent themes throughout the reviews. This ultimately led to the proposal
to study differences in socialization between an on-campus and distance
education class.</p>
    
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The amount of socialization between distance and on-campus respondents showed significance in two areas. First, the on-campus respondents
reported more socialization in their group meetings than did the distance
education respondents. Second, the distance education respondents strongly
disagreed that there was too much socialization, indicating a willingness for
more socialization. While both groups were on the ‘agree’ side of the scale
when asked if everyone in their group contributed equally, it needs to be noted
that the DIST group agreed significantly less. However, more direct measures
for differences in participation did not prove significant.</p>
    
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;This study provides the basis for future research in several ways.
First, there is some support from this preliminary data that socialization
differences do exist between students in on-campus and distance education classes. Second, based on this research, the questionnaire can be
refined so that it can better detect the differences. A factor analysis of this
questionnaire identifies six factors within the data. In four of these factors,
one of the statistically significant characteristics identified in this study
provides the anchor. Finally, the identification and corresponding understanding of the socialization needs associated with learning will help
distance education better achieve its goal of providing a better learning
environment.</p>
